### Tried Scala-Logging using slf4j logFile and logback ut it works for this project.

### I think i need to start learning more about Scala-logging using play-framework(play-api)

### Till now i got parsed only the log file and monitered with the help of Scala need time to set scala-logging once gets understand because this is new framework for me i didn't worked before i learned for this project and i did somewhat within this given time!!
